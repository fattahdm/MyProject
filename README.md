Weather Data Analysis

Introduction

This repository contains my work on weather data analysis. The goal of this project is to explore, visualize, and derive insights from weather datasets using Python and data science tools.

Project Overview

The analysis includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends, distributions, and correlations between weather variables.

Visualizations:

Temperature trends over time

Distribution of temperatures

Correlation heatmap of weather parameters

Monthly variations in weather patterns

How to Run the Analysis

Clone this repository:

git clone (https://github.com/fattahdm/MyProject/blob/main/projek_analisa_cuaca.git)

Open Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload the dataset (if required) and run the notebook cells sequentially.

Requirements

Python

Pandas

Results & Insights

Observed temperature trends over years

Identified correlations between humidity, pressure, and temperature

Monthly weather patterns visualized using boxplots

Future Improvements

Implementing predictive modeling for weather forecasting

Adding more datasets for broader analysis
